<h1>A Mathematical Model for Forecasting the Spread of Covid-19 in Pennsylvania</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In an expansion of a completed SIR mathematical Model research project, students Cody Dosch, Heather Kwolek, Jack DeGroot, and faculty advisor Dr.Craig Johnson create a SVEIR mathematical model for the spread of Covid-19. The SIR model is a simple mathematical model of epidemics that utilizes three compartments of Susceptible, Infected, and Removed. The SVEIR mathematical model is an advanced version of the SIR model with additional compartments of Vaccinated and Exposed. The SVEIR model will provide a more precise outlook on how Covid-19 will spread from person to person in Pennsylvania due to additional parameters. These parameters consist of rates per day that pertain to the vaccine coverage rate over Pennsylvania, the vaccine administered into individuals, symptoms occurring for an infected individual, as well as the recovery rate and death rate of Covid-19. The creation of the SVEIR model was done by expanding our original 3 x 3 system of first-order differential equations to include additional compartments consequently creating a 5 x 5 system of first-order differential equations. We wrote and utilized a C# program that uses the numerical method Runge Kutta to forecast the number of Covid-19 cases within a certain time period t within the population of the state of Pennsylvania. We will utilize our SVEIR model to predict the number of covid cases that will occur within the months of May, June, and July.
